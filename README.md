# Microcontroller-project
In the fourth year, I had a course called "Microcontrollers."
In that course, we learned to program in assembly, and the final project was to create a microprocessor model from scratch that performs binary mathematical operations. We used the "PIC877F16 microchip" kit that includes a keyboard, LCD screen, and more ports (for more information review the practice kit pdf).
